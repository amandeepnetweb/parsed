# Parsed — Project Rules

## What is Parsed

AI-powered document chat tool. Upload PDF, DOCX, TXT, or Markdown files — ask anything about them.
Parsed extracts text, embeds it into Pinecone, and uses Claude to answer questions with source citations.

**Tagline:** Upload any document. Ask anything.

## Database Schema

```
folders       — id, userId, name, parentId (self-ref FK, null = root), createdAt, updatedAt
files         — id, userId, folderId (null = root), name, type, size, blobUrl, status, tags[], createdAt, updatedAt
file_chunks   — id, fileId, chunkIndex, content, pineconeId
```

`status` values: `uploading` → `processing` → `ready` | `error`

Auth tables in `src/db/auth-schema.ts` (users, sessions, accounts, verifications) — managed by Better Auth, never edit manually.

Drizzle config: snake_case, schemas from `src/db/schema.ts` + `src/db/auth-schema.ts`, migrations in `./migrations`.

---

## Pinecone

Index: `parsed` — 1536 dims, cosine metric, namespace per user (`userId`).

Vector metadata per chunk:
```
fileId, fileName, fileType, folderId, folderPath, chunkIndex, tags[], preview (first 200 chars)
```

---

## File Processing Pipeline

```
Upload → Vercel Blob → Extract text → Chunk → Embed → Pinecone upsert → status = ready
```

Parser routing by file type:
- `.pdf`  → `pdf-parse`
- `.docx` → `mammoth`
- `.txt`  → native read
- `.md`   → native read

Always check `file.status === "ready"` before allowing chat on a file.

---

## API Routes

```
GET  /api/files                → list files (?folderId=)
POST /api/files                → upload (multipart/form-data) + trigger processing
GET  /api/files/:id            → metadata + status
DEL  /api/files/:id            → delete file + Blob + Pinecone vectors
POST /api/files/:id/process    → re-trigger extraction + embedding

GET  /api/folders              → full folder tree for authed user
POST /api/folders              → create { name, parentId? }
PUT  /api/folders/:id          → rename { name }
DEL  /api/folders/:id          → { strategy: "move-to-root" | "delete-all" }

POST /api/chat                 → streaming RAG
                                 body: { query, fileIds?, folderId?, tags? }
                                 returns: SSE stream + sources[]
```

## Conventions

### Components
- Add shadcn components via CLI: `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`
- Never edit `src/components/ui/` manually
- Every component folder has an `index.ts` barrel re-exporting all named exports
- Import from barrel, never from the file directly:
  ```ts
  import { FileCard } from "@/components/files"          // correct
  import { FileCard } from "@/components/files/FileCard" // avoid
  ```
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for all class merging — never string concatenation

### Drizzle ORM
- Schema files: `src/db/schemas/*.schema.ts` → re-exported from `src/db/schema.ts`
- Always export `$inferSelect` and `$inferInsert` types
- Migration workflow: edit schema → `pnpm db:generate` → `pnpm db:push`
- Casing: snake_case (configured in `drizzle.config.ts`)

### Better Auth
- Server: `src/lib/auth.ts` — Drizzle adapter
- Client: `src/lib/auth-client.ts` — `createAuthClient`
- API route: `src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`
- Auth tables always in `src/db/auth-schema.ts` — generated, not handwritten

### Database Connection
- `src/lib/database.ts` auto-detects Neon vs local Postgres by URL
- Neon URL (contains `neon.tech`) → `@neondatabase/serverless` HTTP driver
- Local URL → `postgres.js` with connection pooling

npm run dev           # Start dev server
npm run build         # Production build
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run ts:check      # TypeScript check (no emit)
npm run db:generate   # Generate migration files from schema changes
npm run db:migrate    # Apply migrations to the database
# Never use db:push — always use generate + migrate
npm run db:studio     # Drizzle Studio
npm run auth:generate # Regenerate Better Auth schema

## MCP — Context7

Context7 resolves up-to-date library docs on demand.
Config: `.mcp.json` (Claude Code) + `.cursor/mcp.json` (Cursor) — both at project root.

**Lookup order:**
1. Use existing knowledge if confident
2. Query Context7 if unsure about a library API or behavior
3. Web search only if Context7 does not resolve it

Do not web search for anything covered by the libraries listed below.

| Library | Context7 URL |
|---|---|
| Next.js | `https://context7.com/vercel/next.js` |
| Better Auth | `https://context7.com/better-auth/better-auth` |
| shadcn/ui | `https://context7.com/shadcn-ui/ui` |
| React | `https://context7.com/websites/react_dev` |
| Drizzle ORM | `https://context7.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm-docs` |
| Tailwind CSS | `https://context7.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com` |
| TanStack Query | `https://context7.com/websites/tanstack_query` |
| Zod | `https://context7.com/websites/zod_dev` |
| Vercel AI SDK | `https://context7.com/vercel/ai` |
| Pinecone | `https://context7.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-ts-client` |

## Modes

### Default Mode
Used unless explicitly told otherwise. All standard rules apply.

### Strict Mode
Activated when the user writes any of: `STRICT` `CRITICAL CHANGE` `REFACTOR CORE` `BUG INVESTIGATION MODE`

**Pre-change:**
- Grep ALL usages before modifying shared functions, components, types, or configs
- Trace the full execution path
- Identify upstream and downstream impact
- Verify framework behavior if not 100% certain

**During change:**
- Modify only what is necessary
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly told to break it
- Match existing patterns exactly

**Post-change:**
- Verify all call sites still work
- Check for unused imports, dead references, broken dependencies
- If bulk edit, confirm old patterns no longer exist
- Show proof (grep results, logs, test output)

---

## Priority Order

When making decisions or trade-offs, apply in this order:

1. **Correctness** — does it work correctly?
2. **Root cause** — is the actual problem solved, not just the symptom?
3. **Minimal change surface** — fewest files and lines touched
4. **Codebase consistency** — matches existing patterns
5. **Performance** — only optimise when correctness is confirmed

---

## AI Rules

### Verification
- After any find-and-replace or bulk edit, grep for both old and new patterns to confirm all occurrences changed. Never report done without a verification search.
- After modifying code, check for unused imports, dead references, and broken dependencies.
- When fixing a bug, trace the full execution path before writing code. Do not assume how the framework calls your code — verify it.

### Communication
- No fluff. No emojis unless asked. Just answer.
- Do not explain what you're about to do — just do it. Narrate only when the user needs to make a decision.
- If the user is incorrect, correct them directly.
- When reporting changes, show proof (grep results, test output) not just claims.

### Research Priority (follow this order — do not skip steps)

1. **Use existing knowledge first.** If confident about the answer, just answer. Do not look anything up.
2. **Check Context7 second.** If unsure about a library API, signature, or behavior — query Context7 before anything else. Do not web search first.
3. **Web search last resort only.** Only if Context7 does not resolve the question. Do not default to web search.

Never run a search for something you already know. Every unnecessary lookup adds latency and token cost.

### Problem Solving
- Fix the root cause, not symptoms. If a fix fails on first try, stop and re-analyze before retrying.
- Before implementing, identify all locations that need changes (grep first, edit second). Partial fixes are worse than no fix.

### Code Quality
- Match existing code style, patterns, and conventions. Do not introduce new patterns unless explicitly asked.
- Prefer the simplest solution. No abstractions or utilities for one-time operations.
- Do not add comments, docstrings, or type annotations to code you didn't change.

### Workflow
- Read before edit. Always.
- One problem at a time. Do not bundle unrelated changes.
- Verify each step works before moving to the next.

### Interpreting User Intent
- Understand the intent, not just the literal words. If genuinely ambiguous, ask one clarifying question.
- If a request would break existing functionality, flag it before implementing.
- Do not silently add scope beyond what was asked. Mention it briefly and let the user decide.

### Protecting Existing Code
- Do not delete or rewrite code you don't fully understand. Read more context first.
- When touching a function, check who calls it. When touching a component, check who renders it.
- Grep for all usages before changing function signatures.
